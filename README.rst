======================================================================

*Entangle* is a RPC protocol inspired by the official `MessagePack RPC protocol <https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc/blob/master/spec.md>`_ as well as Facebook's `Thrift <https://thrift.apache.org/docs/idl/>`_ with a focus on providing infrastructure and operational level properties. Entangle is designed for exposing services using an Interface Description Language (IDL) with communications based on the MessagePack serialization format in a transport agnostic manner.
